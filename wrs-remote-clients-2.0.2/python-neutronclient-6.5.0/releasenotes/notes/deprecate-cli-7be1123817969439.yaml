deprecations:
  - The neutron CLI is now deprecated. This is the signal that it is
    time to start using the openstack CLI. No new features will be
    added to the neutron CLI, though fixes to the CLI will be assessed
    on a case by case basis. Fixes to the API bindings, as well as
    development of new API bindings as well as OSC plugins are exempt
    from this deprecation.
