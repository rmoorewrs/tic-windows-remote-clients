deprecations:
  - |
    The ``--public`` and ``--private`` attribute of Firewall-as-a-Service v2
    have been deprecated. While the ``--public`` attribute will now be replaced
    by ``--share``, the ``--private`` attribute will be replaced by
    ``--no-share``.  This is because of the similarity between the behavior of
    ``--public`` attribute in FireWall-as-a-Service and the ``--share``
    attribute used in OpenStack.  This deprecation affects the following CLIs.

    * openstack firewall group create
    * openstack firewall group set
    * openstack firewall group unset
    * openstack firewall policy create
    * openstack firewall policy set
    * openstack firewall policy unset
    * openstack firewall rule create
    * openstack firewall rule set
    * openstack firewall rule unset
