Python bindings to the OpenStack Heat API
=========================================

This is a client for OpenStack Heat API. There's a Python API
(the :mod:`heatclient` module), and a command-line script
(installed as :program:`heat`).

Python API
==========

In order to use the python api directly, you must first obtain an auth
token and identify which endpoint you wish to speak to::

  >>> tenant_id = 'b363706f891f48019483f8bd6503c54b'
  >>> heat_url = 'http://heat.example.org:8004/v1/%s' % tenant_id
  >>> auth_token = '3bcc3d3a03f44e3d8377f9247b0ad155'

Once you have done so, you can use the API like so::

  >>> from heatclient.client import Client
  >>> heat = Client('1', endpoint=heat_url, token=auth_token)

Alternatively, you can create a client instance using the keystoneauth session API::

  >>> from keystoneauth1 import loading
  >>> from keystoneauth1 import session
  >>> from heatclient import client
  >>> loader = loading.get_plugin_loader('password')
  >>> auth = loader.load_from_options(auth_url=AUTH_URL,
  ...                                 username=USERNAME,
  ...                                 password=PASSWORD,
  ...                                 project_id=PROJECT_ID)
  >>> sess = session.Session(auth=auth)
  >>> heat = client.Client('1', session=sess)
  >>> heat.stacks.list()

If you have PROJECT_NAME instead of a PROJECT_ID, use the project_name
parameter. Similarly, if your cloud uses keystone v3 and you have a DOMAIN_NAME
or DOMAIN_ID, provide it as `user_domain_(name|id)` and if you are using a
PROJECT_NAME also provide the domain information as `project_domain_(name|id)`.

Command-line Tool
=================

In order to use the CLI, you must provide your OpenStack username,
password, tenant, and auth endpoint. Use the corresponding
configuration options (``--os-username``, ``--os-password``,
``--os-tenant-id``, and ``--os-auth-url``) or set them in environment
variables::

    export OS_USERNAME=user
    export OS_PASSWORD=pass
    export OS_TENANT_ID=b363706f891f48019483f8bd6503c54b
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://auth.example.com:5000/v2.0

The command line tool will attempt to reauthenticate using your
provided credentials for every request. You can override this behavior
by manually supplying an auth token using ``--heat-url`` and
``--os-auth-token``. You can alternatively set these environment
variables::

    export HEAT_URL=http://heat.example.org:8004/v1/b363706f891f48019483f8bd6503c54b
    export OS_AUTH_TOKEN=3bcc3d3a03f44e3d8377f9247b0ad155

Once you've configured your authentication parameters, you can run
``heat help`` to see a complete listing of available commands.
