features:
  - Added '--dep-exists-action' option to murano
    ``package-import`` and ``bundle-import`` commands.
    It allows to specify a different default action for existing main
    package and existing dependencies. In case of specifying just
    '--exists-action', action for dependencies also defaults to it.
