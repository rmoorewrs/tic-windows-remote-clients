    As of keystoneclient 2.2.0, the session and auth plugins code has
    been deprecated. These modules have been moved to the keystoneauth
    library. Consumers of the session and plugin modules are encouraged
    to move to keystoneauth. Note that there should be no change to
    end users of glanceclient.
