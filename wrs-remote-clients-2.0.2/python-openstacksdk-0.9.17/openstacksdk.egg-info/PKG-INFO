Description: OpenStack Python SDK
        ====================
        
        The ``python-openstacksdk`` is a collection of libraries for building
        applications to work with OpenStack clouds. The project aims to provide
        a consistent and complete set of interactions with OpenStack's many
        services, along with complete documentation, examples, and tools.
        
        This SDK is under active development, and in the interests of providing
        a high-quality interface, the APIs provided in this release may differ
        from those provided in future release.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The following example simply connects to an OpenStack cloud and lists
        the containers in the Object Store service.::
        
           from openstack import connection
           conn = connection.Connection(auth_url="http://openstack:5000/v3",
                                        project_name="big_project",
                                        username="SDK_user",
                                        password="Super5ecretPassw0rd")
           for container in conn.object_store.containers():
              print(container.name)
