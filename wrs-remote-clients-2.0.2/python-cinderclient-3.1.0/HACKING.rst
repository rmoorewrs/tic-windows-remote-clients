- Step 2: Read on

Cinder Client Specific Commandments
-----------------------------------

General
-------
- Use 'raise' instead of 'raise e' to preserve original traceback or exception being reraised::

    except Exception as e:
        ...
        raise e  # BAD

    except Exception:
        ...
        raise  # OKAY

Release Notes
-------------
- Any patch that makes a change significant to the end consumer or deployer of an
  OpenStack environment should include a release note (new features, upgrade impacts,
  deprecated functionality, significant bug fixes, etc.)

- Cinder Client uses Reno for release notes management. See the `Reno Documentation`_
  for more details on its usage.

.. _Reno Documentation: https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/

- As a quick example, when adding a new shell command for Awesome Storage Feature, one
  could perform the following steps to include a release note for the new feature:

    $ tox -e venv -- reno new add-awesome-command
    $ vi releasenotes/notes/add-awesome-command-bb8bb8bb8bb8bb81.yaml

  Remove the extra template text from the release note and update the details so it
  looks something like:

    ---
    features:
      - Added shell command `cinder be-awesome`  for Awesome Storage Feature.

- Include the generated release notes file when submitting your patch for review.
