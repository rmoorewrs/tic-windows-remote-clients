    Fixes `bug 1705093`_ by having the
    ``cinderclient.client.get_highest_client_server_version`` method return a
    string rather than a float. The problem with returning a float is when a
    user of that method would cast the float result to a str which turns 3.40,
    for example, into "3.4" which is wrong.
