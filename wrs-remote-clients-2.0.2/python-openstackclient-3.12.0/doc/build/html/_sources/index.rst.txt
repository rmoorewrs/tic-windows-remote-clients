OpenStackClient (aka OSC) is a command-line client for OpenStack that
brings the command set for Compute, Identity, Image, Object Storage and
Block Storage APIs together in a single shell with a uniform command
structure.

Project Goals
-------------

* Use the OpenStack Python API libraries, extending or replacing them as required
* Use a consistent naming and structure for commands and arguments
* Provide consistent output formats with optional machine parseable formats
* Use a single-binary approach that also contains an embedded shell that can execute
  multiple commands on a single authentication (see libvirt's virsh for an example)
* Independence from the OpenStack project names; only API names are referenced (to
  the extent possible)

Contributing
============

OpenStackClient utilizes all of the usual OpenStack processes and requirements for
contributions.  The code is hosted `on OpenStack's Git server`_. `Bug reports`_
and `blueprints`_ may be submitted to the :code:`python-openstackclient` project
on `Launchpad`_.  Code may be submitted to the
:code:`openstack/python-openstackclient` project using `Gerrit`_.
Developers may also be found in the `IRC channel`_ ``#openstack-sdks``.
